# chat-view

Source: `src/sidekickView.ts` (panel shell, session orchestration) plus `src/view/*`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `configToolbar.ts` | Agent / model / reasoning-effort / skills / tools / working-dir / debug controls |
| `inputArea.ts` | Message input, slash-command prompts, attachments, vault scope button |
| `chatRenderer.ts` | Markdown rendering of messages, reasoning blocks, tool-call details |
| `sessionSidebar.ts` | Session list, restore (cold resume via `getEvents()`), rename/delete, background sessions |
| `searchPanel.ts` | AI vault search tab (basic/advanced) |
| `triggersPanel.ts` | Triggers tab (status, history) |
| `sessionConfig.ts` | Builds `SessionConfig` from selected agent/skills/tools/settings |

Modals (`src/modals/*`): tool approval, elicitation forms, user input (ask_user), edit modal,
vault scope, folder tree.

## Behavior contracts

- Streaming: sessions are created with `streaming: true`; renderer accumulates
  `assistant.message_delta` / `assistant.reasoning_delta`, finalizes on `assistant.message`.
- Reasoning-effort menu shows only when the selected model reports
  `capabilities.supports.reasoningEffort` and a non-empty `supportedReasoningEfforts`; an
  unsupported persisted level resets to `''`.
- Session restore: resume by id with the full current session config, re-select agent via
  `session.rpc.agent.select`, replay history from `session.getEvents()`
  (`user.message`, `assistant.reasoning`, `assistant.message`).
- The active note is attached as context; working directory follows the active note's folder
  unless overridden in the toolbar.
- Sessions are auto-named `<Agent>: <first message>`; trigger/search sessions are tagged.

## Planned changes

- Issue 0003: reasoning-summary control next to the reasoning-effort menu.
- Issue 0004: long-context tier toggle in the model menu (only for supporting models).
- Issue 0005: infinite-sessions (auto-compaction) setting + compaction visibility in debug view.
